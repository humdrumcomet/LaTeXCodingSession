# LaTeX Interactive Coding Session

This is the blank companion document to the LaTeX introduction workshop (main repo here [here](https://github.com/humdrumcomet/LaTeXIntroduction)).
This empty document is intended to be used as a starting point for a guided coding session, but can work well as a starting point for a separate project as well.
